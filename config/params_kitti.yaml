  # - recommend to use the first removing resolution's magnifier ratio should meet the seonsor vertical fov / number of rays 
  #     - e.g., HDL 64E of KITTI dataset -> appx 25 deg / 64 ray ~ 0.4 deg per pixel -> the magnifier ratio = 1/0.4 = 2.5
  #     - e.g., Ouster OS1-64 of MulRan dataset -> appx 45 deg / 64 ray ~ 0.7 deg per pixel -> the magnifier ratio = 1/0.7 = 1.4
  # - recommend to use the first reverting resolution's magnifier ratio should lied in 1.0 to 1.5
